Description: Differential network modeling, or network comparison, has become an essential tool for identifying differences in brain connectivity between healthy and affected individuals. We propose a Cooperative Differential Network Learning (CDNL) method for the spatial by temporal matrix-valued fMRI data from multiple research centers, aimed at achieving better joint estimation of multiple differential networks.
